Description

The project is about forming rules of translation between English and Hindi using word sense
disambiguation( WSD ) which governs the process of identifying the sense of a word in a
sentence which usually has various meanings . Our aim is to collect data related to it from a
variety of users in an interesting way .Given a word it has multiple senses and when translated to
some other language it can be translated into multiple words out of which one is chosen based on
context. We will be building a rich interface to collect this information from the
user. Based on the context given by user , we further encourage the users to provide us with
appropriate reasons for their choices . After this is accomplished , in the next part of the project
we will be building an interface to implement the rules derived from the reasons provided by the
users . This will help us in natural language processing and machine interpretation .

Profile of Users

The end user can be any person with basic understanding of English and Hindi languages . The
user will be providing us with the meanings and translations of various words in English to Hindi
and also the corresponding reasons for their choices . The user should have basic knowledge of
computer regarding how to operate it , etc .
There will be administrators who will be managing the site and resolving any issues faced by the
end-user .

Usage Model

The interface provided to the end-user will be highly interactive and appealing . At each step user
will be provided with English sentences and later on will be asked for the meanings of particular
words in those sentences in Hindi (Hints will be given for the same) . He will be also asked for
the reasons for his/her choices regarding the context of those words . Based on the responses
provided by the user , a database will be formed which will help in forming the general rules for
translation .
